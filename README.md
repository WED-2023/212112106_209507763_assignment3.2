### About the Project  
-----------------  
This project implements a RESTful backend server for the Assignment 3.2 requirements.  
It handles HTTP requests for managing data, performs CRUD operations on a connected database,  
and provides JSON responses to the frontend. Key features include:

- Node.js with Express framework  
- REST API endpoints for data manipulation  
- Connection and interaction with a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL)  
- Middleware for request parsing, logging, and error handling  
- Basic authentication and security best practices (if applicable)  

This backend is designed to work seamlessly with the corresponding frontend to deliver a full-stack web application experience.
